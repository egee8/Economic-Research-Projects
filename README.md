Hello!

My name is Erica Teryse Gonzales, and I am recent graduate from Minerva Schools at KGI where I majored in Economics. 
I value inclusion, innovation, & reducing social inequity, and I hope to have a career that shares and strives towards these values.

Right now, I'm currently searching for job, specifically an economic research assistant position, in which I can participate in evidence-based policy research related to
education, labor, and health equity or economic development.
