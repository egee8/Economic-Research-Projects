Hello!

My name is Erica Teryse Gonzales, and I am a recent graduate from Minerva Schools at KGI where I majored in Economics. 
I value inclusion, innovation, & reducing social inequity, and I hope to have a career that shares and strives towards these values.

Right now, I'm currently searching for a job, specifically an economic research assistant position, in which I can participate in evidence-based policy research related to education, labor, and health equity. I intend to pursue a PhD in economics in a few years, and I hope being a research assistant will prepare me to apply as a competitive candidate and determine where I want to specialize in economics.

This repository contains the coding work I've done the past two years from my economics classes and some independent research (coming soon). I'm proficient in R and Stata, and have some experience in Python (willing to learn and improve this technical skill).

Please reach out at anytime at gonzaleserica08@gmail.com
